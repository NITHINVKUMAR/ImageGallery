# ImageGallery

As part of my web development journey, I undertook a project to create an Image Gallery using HTML, CSS, and CSS Grids. 
The objective was to design and implement a visually appealing and responsive gallery that showcases a collection of images.

I began by structuring the HTML markup, creating a container to hold the gallery and individual elements for each image. 
To enhance accessibility, I added alt text to describe the images for users who may rely on screen readers.

Next, I employed CSS to style the gallery. I utilized CSS Grids, a powerful layout system, to create a flexible and dynamic grid structure for positioning the images. 
With CSS Grids, I was able to define the number of columns, their widths, and the gap between them, resulting in a clean and organized layout.

To enhance the visual presentation, I applied CSS properties such as borders, shadows, and transitions to give the gallery a polished look. 
I also incorporated responsive design techniques, using media queries to adjust the grid layout and image sizes based on different screen sizes. 
This ensured that the gallery would look great and be functional across various devices, from desktops to mobile devices.

Throughout the project, I focused on writing clean and maintainable code, adhering to best practices and following coding standards. 
I also paid attention to cross-browser compatibility, testing the gallery on multiple browsers to ensure consistent performance.
